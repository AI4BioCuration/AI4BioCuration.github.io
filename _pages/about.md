AI4Biocuration is a collaborative initiative dedicated to advancing the use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) in the management, curation, and dissemination of biological data. As biodata resources continue to grow in scale and complexity, integrating AI/ML offers a path toward more efficient, sustainable, and scalable curation practices.

Our Mission
======
Our mission is to bridge the gap between biocuration and computational science by fostering cross-disciplinary collaboration, promoting transparency in automation, and developing best practices for the responsible use of AI. We emphasize practical applications, sustainable tooling, and FAIR data principles to ensure that machine-assisted curation enhances—rather than replaces—the work of human experts.

AI4Biocuration serves as a hub for biocurators, data infrastructure leaders, ML researchers, and industry practitioners to:
- Share experiences with AI/ML integration into biocuration workflows
- Identify real-world challenges and opportunities for automation
- Promote the creation and sharing of high-quality, curated datasets for training models
- Encourage the development of transparent, cost-effective, and fit-for-purpose AI solutions
Through community engagement and knowledge sharing, we aim to shape a future where AI augments the essential work of biocurators and contributes to the long-term sustainability of the biodata ecosystem.
